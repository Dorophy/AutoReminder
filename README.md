# AutoReminder

The main purpose of this project is to relieve TPMs from daily chore of manually chasing down OKR updates/status. Thus this project serves the goal of automatically sending emails to OKR owners who hasnâ€™t updated their OKRs in the past 7 days. Also, the code in this repo would also provide OKR summary to respective engineering managers.
